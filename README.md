## Summary
This repo contains an example usage of pytest.

## Setup
You will need python installed
Project uses pytest, so you need to run `pip install pytest`

TODO: replace this with a requirements file to facilitate installing dependencies


## How to run tests
If using pyCharm, you can either right-click the file name and select run tests OR within the test file click the Run Icon.

If running the tests from the terminal you can do.

`pytest tests/test_my_functions.py`

If you want any print statements or logging to be output to the terminal you can add `-s` parameter, which will enable all output to be displayed even if a test passes.
